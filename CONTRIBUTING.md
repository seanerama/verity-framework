# Contributing to Verity

Thanks for your interest in improving Verity. This guide covers the local setup,
how to run the checks, and the conventions that keep the codebase consistent.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 16.7**
- **git** and the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) — Verity is GitHub-native, and several
  roles shell out to `gh` at runtime.

```bash
node -v && git --version && gh --version
```

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanerama/verity-framework.git
cd verity-framework
npm install        # the only dependency is Biome (lint/format)
```

To try your local checkout as the global CLI:

```bash
npm link           # makes `verity` point at this checkout
verity help        # lists every CLI command
```

## Running the checks

Two checks gate every change — both must pass (they also run automatically on
`npm publish` via `prepublishOnly`):

```bash
npm test           # runs the test suite
npm run lint       # Biome formatter + linter (CI mode)
```

### Tests

The runner (`scripts/run-tests.cjs`) is deliberately zero-dependency: it discovers
every `tests/*.test.cjs`, injects three globals — `test`, `assert`, `assertEqual` —
runs them, and exits non-zero on any failure. It **refuses a vacuous pass**: if no
test files exist, it fails.

Add a test by dropping a new file in `tests/`:

```js
// tests/my-thing.test.cjs
const mything = require('../verity/bin/lib/mything.cjs');

test('does the thing', () => {
  assertEqual(mything.dispatch(['arg'], {}).raw, 'expected');
  assert(somethingTruthy, 'optional message');
});
```

No `require` of the runner, no imports of a framework — just call `test(...)`.

### Lint & format

Biome enforces 2-space indentation, single quotes, and a 100-character line width.
`docs/**`, all `*.md` files, and `verity/templates/**` are intentionally ignored
(see `biome.json`). To auto-fix locally:

```bash
npx biome check --write .
```

## Project layout

```
verity/
  bin/verity.cjs        CLI dispatcher — routes `verity <noun>` to a lib module
  bin/lib/*.cjs         one module per command (config, stage, ledger, release, …)
  templates/*.tmpl      files the scaffolder writes into a new project
  design-guides/*.md    built-in architecture guides the Architect role offers
commands/verity/*.md    the 13 role slash commands (the public surface)
docs/                   public docs, specs, and the interactive HTML guides
tests/*.test.cjs        the suite
scripts/run-tests.cjs   the runner
```

## Conventions

- **The CLI is the deterministic layer.** `verity/bin/verity.cjs` emits JSON by
  default, supports `--raw` for plain scalar values, and is **read-only with
  respect to integration state** — it derives truth from GitHub rather than
  writing stale local files. Keep new commands in that spirit.
- **One module, one `dispatch`.** Each `verity/bin/lib/*.cjs` exports a
  `dispatch(rest, flags)` and is wired into the `COMMANDS` map in `verity.cjs`.
- **Role commands mirror the engine.** A slash command in `commands/verity/`
  orchestrates the human-facing role; the heavy, deterministic acts live behind
  `verity` CLI calls. See [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) for the full map.
- **No new runtime dependencies.** The package ships with zero runtime deps;
  please keep it that way unless there's a strong reason to discuss.

## Submitting changes

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Make the change with a test that covers it.
3. Ensure `npm test && npm run lint` are both green.
4. Open a PR with a clear description of the *why*, not just the *what*.

## Design background

For the reasoning behind the architecture, see
[`docs/framework-spec.md`](docs/framework-spec.md) (build-ready spec) and
[`docs/roles-spec.md`](docs/roles-spec.md) (full role rationale).
