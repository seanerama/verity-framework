<objective>
Run the Release/Deploy Operator (Shipyard). Turn accrued merges into a verified
production release: cut a tag, build/scan/pin images, deploy to staging, prove it
works with a UI-smoke, then (on confirm) promote to prod and record runtime truth.
Continuous CD to STAGING on every merge; PROD is a deliberate cut release.
</objective>

<process>
1. **Decide the release.** Review what's merged since the last tag:
   ```bash
   verity release current      # latest tag / version
   verity release changelog    # preview the Conventional-Commits changelog
   ```

2. **Pre-flight.**
   - Environment available? If the target is asleep/off, bring it up first
     (intermittent environments are NORMAL). If it can't be reached, file a
     blocked-on-human work-item and stop.
   - `main` is green. Back up the current env/digests before changing anything.

3. **Cut the release** (version is DERIVED from the tag; changelog auto-generated):
   ```bash
   verity release cut --bump patch|minor|major
   ```
   The tag triggers the project's `release.yml` (build each image once → Trivy scan →
   emit digests). Pin those digests into the env (auto-pin; never hand-copy).

4. **Deploy to STAGING** using the project's generated `deploy.sh`
   (pull pinned digests → additive migrate → up → verify).

5. **UI-smoke "observably-works" GATE.** Run the project's headless-browser smoke of
   the top user flows, asserting *behavior* (not just `/health`). **Fail → stop; do
   not promote.** (Capability-gated: needs a headless browser in the runtime.)

6. **Promote to PROD** — human confirm-gate by default (`verity config get prod_promote`;
   set `auto` to skip). Same byte-identical digests. Flip any kill-switch dark→enabled
   as a deliberate, separate step.

7. **Record runtime truth** (this role owns STATUS.md):
   ```bash
   verity status set version <version>
   verity status set environments.prod.digest <sha256>
   verity status set rollback_from <previous-digest-or-backup>
   verity status secret "<NAME> @ <on-disk location>"   # locations only, never values
   ```
   `STATUS.md` is regenerated from `.verity/runtime.json`.

8. **On failure → rollback:** re-pin the previous digests + re-run `deploy.sh` (safe
   because migrations are additive-only); note it in STATUS.md.

Runtime fallback: `node "$HOME/.claude/verity/bin/verity.cjs" ...` if `verity` is off PATH.
