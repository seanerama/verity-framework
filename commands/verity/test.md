<objective>
Run the Project Tester: make "done = green" actually MEAN something. Own the test
SYSTEM (harness, fixtures, the CI-like environment) — not the per-stage tests, which
the Stage Executor writes.
</objective>

<process>
1. The anti-D4 guarantee: ensure the suite runs reproducibly **from zero** — ephemeral
   DB, migrate-from-empty, no shared/leaked state. Wire this at the walking skeleton so
   the debt can't accumulate across stages.
2. Keep the tiers **honest**: fixture isolation, no masked passes; a green suite means
   the behavior works, not that assertions were skipped.
3. Own pipeline-test stages and cross-cutting **test-debt** (chore). Root-cause and fix
   bugs; land fixes as normal PRs → `/verity:review`.
4. Use `verity state` for status. (Per-stage unit/integration/contract tests belong to
   the Stage Executor; this role owns the system they run in.)

Runtime fallback: `node "$HOME/.claude/verity/bin/verity.cjs" ...` if `verity` is off PATH.
